# Graph-Adjacency-Matrix-and-List-C-Implementation

<p>This project implements an undirected and unweighted graph using both an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list in C++. The program provides functionality to initialize the graph, insert edges, and display the graph's structure in both matrix and list formats. This implementation is designed for educational purposes, specifically for the Data Structures and Algorithms course.</p>

### Here's a brief breakdown of the program:
<b>Graph Initialization</b>: Initializes the adjacency matrix to represent an empty graph.
<b>Edge Insertion</b>: Adds edges between specified vertices, updating the adjacency matrix accordingly.
<b>Adjacency Matrix Display</b>: Prints the adjacency matrix, showing the connections between vertices.
<b>Adjacency List Display</b>: Converts the adjacency matrix into an adjacency list and prints the list, showing the neighbors of each vertex.

### Compile and Run the Program
<p>To compile and run the program, follow these steps in your terminal:</p>
<b>Compile the Program</b>:
<pre><code>g++ -o graph graph.cpp</code></pre>
<b>Run the Program</b>:
<pre><code>./graph</code></pre>

### Usage
<p>1. <b>Initialization</b>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The graph is initialized to have no edges, with all values in the adjacency matrix set to 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. <b>Edge Insertion</b>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Edges are inserted by specifying pairs of vertices, and the adjacency matrix is updated to reflect these connections.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. <b>Graph Display</b>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The adjacency matrix is printed, showing the connections between vertices as 1s in the matrix.</li>
    <li>The adjacency list is printed, showing each vertex's neighbors.</li>
</ul>
